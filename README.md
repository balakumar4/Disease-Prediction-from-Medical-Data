# ðŸ©º Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Breast Cancer** using structured medical datasets.  
Multiple machine learning models were trained, evaluated, and the best model was selected for each dataset based on performance metrics.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Predict disease risk based on patient medical data.
- Compare ML algorithms: **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost**.
- Handle missing values and class imbalance using **imputation** and **SMOTE**.
- Evaluate with **5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation**.
- Provide options for **real-time prediction** using saved models or an API.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets
1. **Diabetes**: Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (CSV)  
2. **Heart Disease**: UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset  
3. **Breast Cancer**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (from scikit-learn)

Preprocessing steps:
- Missing value imputation  
- Scaling (for LR, SVM)  
- SMOTE for class imbalance  

---

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- SVM (RBF)  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

Best model per dataset was selected based on **ROC-AUC** and **F1-score**.
